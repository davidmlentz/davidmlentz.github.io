This is the portfolio site of David M. Lentz (davidmlentz@gmail.com). The purpose of this portfolio is to compile and display my recent work in the field of technical communication.

In my current job, I create documents for the WordPress Support team at Boise State University:
* [Switching a WordPress Site From Jetpack-Based Subscriptions to Mailchimp](https://github.com/OITWPsupport/documentation/blob/master/Moving%20Site%20Subscriptions%20to%20Mailchimp.md)
* [Boise State uPay Gravity Forms Extension for LSAMP](https://github.com/OITWPsupport/boise-state-uPay-Gravity-Forms-Extension-for-LSAMP/blob/master/docs/developerhowto.md)

I recently completed an MA in technical communication. As part of my coursework, I created user documentation:
* Freemake Video Converter
    * [Making Slideshows and Visualizations](http://davidmlentz.github.io/software_procedures1.html)
    * [Downloading a Video From the Web](http://davidmlentz.github.io/software_procedures2.html)
    * [Adding Audio](http://davidmlentz.github.io/software_procedures3.html)

I also studied content management and wrote a bit about it:

Hereâ€™s a white paper I wrote as a final project one semester:
