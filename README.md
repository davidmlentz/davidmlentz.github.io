This is the portfolio site of David M. Lentz (davidmlentz@gmail.com). The purpose of this portfolio is to compile and display my recent work in the field of technical communication.

I recently completed an MA in technical communication. As part of my coursework, I wrote a white paper as a final project:
* [Telemedicine and Business Efficiency: Improving Patient Outcomes](http://davidmlentz.github.io/white_paper.pdf)

I also studied content management and wrote a bit about it:
* [How XML Supports a Unified Content Strategy](http://davidmlentz.github.io/HowXMLSupportsaUnifiedContentStrategy.pdf)

I wrote this article helping users configure virtual servers:
* [How To Set Up the Latest MediaWiki with Lighttpd on Ubuntu 14.04](https://github.com/davidmlentz/davidmlentz.github.io/blob/master/How%20To%20Set%20Up%20the%20Latest%20MediaWiki%20with%20Lighttpd%20on%20Ubuntu%2014.04.md)
