This is the portfolio site of David M. Lentz (davidmlentz@gmail.com). The purpose of this portfolio is to display some of my technical writing.

I recently completed an MA in technical communication. I wrote a white paper as a final project in that program:
* [Telemedicine and Business Efficiency: Improving Patient Outcomes](http://davidmlentz.github.io/white_paper.pdf)

I also studied content management and wrote a bit about it:
* [How XML Supports a Unified Content Strategy](http://davidmlentz.github.io/HowXMLSupportsaUnifiedContentStrategy.pdf)

I wrote this article helping users configure virtual servers:
* [How To Set Up the Latest MediaWiki with Lighttpd on Ubuntu 14.04](https://github.com/davidmlentz/davidmlentz.github.io/blob/master/How%20To%20Set%20Up%20the%20Latest%20MediaWiki%20with%20Lighttpd%20on%20Ubuntu%2014.04.md)

These articles are my contribution to freeCodeCamp documentation for Hacktoberfest 2017:
* [10 Simple and Useful Linux Commands](https://github.com/davidmlentz/guides/blob/patch-1/src/pages/linux/10-simple-and-useful-linux-commands/index.md)
* [Linux: Writing a Bash Script](https://github.com/davidmlentz/guide-articles/blob/master/articles/Linux/writing-a-bash-script.md)

In my current job, I create documents for the WordPress Support team at Boise State University:
* [Switching a WordPress Site From Jetpack-Based Subscriptions to Mailchimp](https://github.com/OITWPsupport/documentation/blob/master/Moving%20Site%20Subscriptions%20to%20Mailchimp.md)
