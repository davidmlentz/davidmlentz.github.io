INSTALLATION

Building a Digibuddy (updated 20070302):

(This process takes about 20 minutes on a 2.4GHz machine, 20x CD-ROM.)

1.  Install Debian 3.1 from Netinst CD, w/no optional packages.

When installation is complete, log in as "root" and continue.


2a.  Add user dcr, password=****

	digibuddy:~# adduser dcr

Follow prompts.


2b.  Add user digibuddy, password=****

	digibuddy:~# adduser digibuddy

Follow prompts.


3.  Load "APC Install Disc 2" and type:

	digibuddy:~# mount -o exec /dev/hdc
	digibuddy:~# /media/cdrom0/apc_create.sh apc_0_9_4_branch
	
Accept all defaults.
	

4.  When the Digibuddy pauses with the prompt: 

	vmc@shell.modwest.com's password

Type the password "****" to continue.


5.  When installation is complete, type this command:

	digibuddy:~# crontab -e

This will open a text editor.  Type the following:
	
	1 0 * * * /usr/lib/cgi-bin/apc/affidavitAutoGetYesterday.cgi
	2 4 * * * /usr/lib/cgi-bin/apc/setclock.sh
	
Then hold down CTRL and SHIFT, and type "X".
	
The editor will ask:

	Save modified buffer (ANSWERING "No" WILL DESTROY CHANGES)?
	
Type "Y", then ENTER.


6.  Type this command:

	digibuddy:~# /usr/lib/cgi-bin/apc/setclock.sh
	
This will set the 974's clock to match the clock on the Digibuddy. This script will run again each night to keep the clock
accurate.


7.  Restart the Digibuddy:

	digibuddy:~# shutdown -r now
	

8.	Connect the DCR-974's ethernet port to the Digibuddy's eth1 port using an ethernet crossover cable.


9.	Use the DCR-974's front-panel controls to configure the IP settings as follows:

IP address: 192.168.210.1
NCS UDP Port: 09740
Concole UDP Port: 09741

Restart the receiver to make sure these settings take effect.


10.	Point a browser to 192.168.3.99 to test your Digibuddy installation.  Log in with the username "admin" and the
password "****".  As soon as you've logged in, click the "change my password" link to  choose a new password for this account.

Next, click the "Back up" link under "Receiver file inventory" on the left side of the screen.  Follow the prompts to complete the receiver backup.

The backup process may take 10 - 20 minutes, depending on the file inventory of your receiver.
